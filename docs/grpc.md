### Grpc port

Each chain has a unique Grpc port:
```
Grpc port = 9000 + <index>
```

- Where `<index>` of chain could be found in the [README](../README.md)

Eg.,
```
1. Osmosis => Grpc port = 9000 + 1 = 9001
2. Starname => Grpc port = 9000 + 2 = 9002
3. Regen  => Grpc port = 9000 + 3 = 9003
...
```
